### Welcome to the **`PRIMsrc`** project. This website describes the goal of PRIMsrc and why/how you can use it. It also provides some general remarks and links about the software. 

***
### _Idea_

PRIMsrc is a generic method to perform a Bump Hunting search in high-dimensional data. The method generates decision rules delineating a region in the multi-dimensional predictor space, where a target function of interest assumes larger (or smaller) values than its average over the entire space.

The picture below illustrates the idea. The sunshine over the mountain range shows how light can uncover peaks, highlands and valleys, just like we want to do for data structures such as local/global extrema by using a PRIMsrc-based Bump Hunting approach.

### _Why Use PRIMsrc?_

The problem of "Bump Hunting" covers mathematical / statistical tasks such as:
* Mode(s) Hunting
* Local/Global Extremum(a) Finding
* Subgroup(s) Identification
* Outlier(s) Detection
* …

Benefits:
* characterization and stratification of samples into new groups

Direct applications are multiple:
* personalized medicine (improved accuracy of diagnostication and/or prognostication)  
* economical medicine (hot spotting)
* alternative drug/treatment indication (re-purposing)
* system reliability analysis in engineering  
* duration analysis/modeling in economics
* event history analysis in sociology
* financial securities return
* insurance risk assessment
* …
