---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-07-28
o RELEASE 0.5.7
- Initial release to CRAN.
- Compliance with new R CMD check, which now checks code usage via 'codetools'.
  Functions and packages from default packages other than base which are used in the package
  code are now imported via the package namespace file (NAMESPACE).
  Added new field 'Imports' in the package description file (DESCRIPTION) 
  to match the functions and packages newly imported via NAMESPACE.
- Added Cumulative Hazard Summary statistic (derived from the Nelson-Aalen estimator) 
  as new peeling criterion option in the PRSP algorithm.
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-07-20 r68705) and release update to GitHub. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-08-28
o RELEASE 0.5.8
- Removed pre-selection of variables (covariates) by regular Cox-regression
  and made the remaining Elastic-Net pre-selection of variables optional by
  passing an additional argument in the main function sbh().
- Main function `sbh()` now returns the parameters used for configuring the parallelization.
- Replaced real dataset #2 of breast cancer data with lung cancer data for reason of size.
- Added S3-generic `print` function and updated S3-generic `summary` function.
- Created a new internal subroutine cv.presel() for (optional) variable pre-selection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-09-07
o RELEASE 0.5.9
- Replaced plotting function `plot_scatter(...)` by S3-generic `plot()` function.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-09-15
o RELEASE 0.6.0
- The matrix of original dataset is now returned by the main function `sbh()` 
  and not the submatrix of pre-selected covariates only.
- Corrected bugs in the output of main function `sbh()`: 
  . the returned vectors of 'screened' and 'used' covariates are now in reference 
    to the original index of variables.
  . the value of traces and rules are now matched accordingly.
- The value of `object$cvfit$cv.trace` of the `PRSP` object that is returned 
  by the main function sbh() now only contains the vector of the modal trace values 
  of covariate usage at each step.
- Updated S3-generic `print()` function as well as `plot_boxtraj()` and `plot_boxtrace()` accordingly.  
- Minor updates and corrections in the documentation file and manual.
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-09-14 r69384) and release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-10-11
o RELEASE 0.6.2
- Rename example datasets #4 and #5 into #1b and #4, respectively, 
  for consistency with companion article.
- Added argument `decimals` to main function `sbh()` to output results in
  user-specified significant decimals.
- Added examples for all S3-generic functions.
- Corrected output of decision rules in S3-generic `print` function in case `vs=TRUE`.

  moved them to 'cvfit' field of return `PRSP` object.
- Minor improvement in output plot axes names of `plot_boxtrace()` function.  
- Updates of corresponding modifications in the documentation file and manual.
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-09-14 r69384) and release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-11-16
o RELEASE 0.6.3
- Changed random splitting in the cross-validation step to random stratified splitting 
  with/by conservation of events.
- Changed default values of metaparameters `alpha` to 0.05 (instead of 0.10) 
                                           `minn` to 5     (instead of 10).
- Modified computation of replicated cross-validated maximal peeling length in order to avoid 
  getting below the minimal box support threshold (i.e. the greater of `beta*n` or `minn`) 
  that could occur when combining results from the cross-validation loops and replicates. 
- Corrected behaviors in case `n` is less than `minn` and `n` is equal to `minn`.
- Corrected minor errors in `list2array()` and `list2mat()` internal functions.
- Corrected minor errors in `plot()` and `predict()` S3-generic functions.
- Updates in the manual file, including added explanation about the outputs of 
  averaged covariate traces, box membership indicators and box decision rules.  
- Updates in the CITATION file.  
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-11-04 r69597) and release update to GitHub.

o RELEASE 0.7.0
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
- Renamed class object `PRSP` by `sbh`.
- Renamed input value `arg` by `cvarg`.
- Renamed input value `cpv` by `pv`.
- Renamed input value of `parallel` by `parallel.rep` and added two more parallelization options 
  `parallel.vs` and `parallel.pv` for variable screening (pre-selection) 
  and computation of p-values, respectively.
- Renamed output value `selected` by `screened`.
- Removed input value `cvcriterion`. Now specified in `cvarg` (see below).
- Removed options `NULL` and `none` from cross-validation type `cvtype` and criterion `cvcriterion`.
- Removed argument `thr`. Now done internally.
- Added new user option `cv` in main function `sbh()` for optional cross-validation.
- Added new user option `vs` in main function `sbh()` for optional variable screening (pre-selection) procedure.
- Added new user option `vstype` in main function `sbh()` for variable screening (pre-selection) type.
- Added new user option `vsarg` in main function `sbh()` for variable screening (pre-selection) parameters.
- Added new user option `onese` in main function `sbh()` for using the 1SE rule.
- Added new user option `verbose` in main function `sbh()`.
- Modified user input in main function `sbh()` by using (`X`, `y`, `delta`) instead of `dataset`.
- Modified `sbh()` output values of `object$cvfit$cv.rules` and `object$cvfit$cv.sign` of the `sbh` object. 
  Results now contain `used` (selected) covariates instead of `screened` (pre-selected) ones.
- Changed default value of replications `B` to 30 (instead of 10).
- Changed default value of metaparameter `alpha` to 0.01 (instead of 0.05).
- Changed format and values of argument `conf` for setting up the parallel backend in case a parallel 
  cluster of computers is desired. 
NEW FEATURES
- Implemented four variable screening (pre-selection) procedures before variable usage (selection) procedure is done. 
  User can now choose between: 
  1. Univariate Patient Recursive Survival Peeling algorithm (default of our package "PRIMsrc")
  2. Penalized Censored Quantile Regression (by Semismooth Newton Coordinate Descent algorithm adapted from package "hqreg")
  3. Penalized Partial Likelihood (adapted from package "glmnet")
  4. Supervised Principal Component Analysis (adapted from package "superpc"). 
- New `sbh()` output values in `object$cvprofiles` of the `sbh` object (in matrix format) to plot 
  cross-validation criterion as a funtion of both variables screening size profiles 
  and peeling length profiles, as it applies.
BUG FIXES
- Improved treatment of no variable pre-selection.
- Removed extraneous codes in main function `sbh()`.
- Corrected rare error in the determination of cross-validated parameter tuning in `cv.ppl()` and `cv.pcqr()` 
  for variable selection procedures 2 and 3 above, respectively.
- Corrected discrepancy in a given step between `object$cvfit$cv.boxind` and `object$cvfit$cv.stats`. 
- Corrected internal function `cv.folds()` to handle degenerate cases of cross-validation and the case 
  when an outcome `y` is not provided (in which case a regular random splitting is performed that is not 
  supervised stratified).
- Simplified management of replications in case of failure: any failed replication is simply removed.
- Corrected number of replications to match the exact same number as user request and not a multiple 
  of the number of available cpus.
- The seed now applies to the computation of permutation p-values.
UTILITIES
- Updated real dataset #2 of lung cancer genomic data (miRNA) to inlude 5 additional clinical variables.
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT
- Management of parallelization is now done by specific user input, independently of `cvtype` 
  and `cvcriterion` options.
- Parallel cluster or communication mechanism now only allows type 'Socket' or 
  'Message-Passing Interface' ('MPI'). "PRIMsrc" no longer supports 'Parallel Virtual Machine' ('PVM').
