  Functions and packages from default packages other than base which are used in the package
  code are now imported via the package namespace file (NAMESPACE).
  Added new field 'Imports' in the package description file (DESCRIPTION) 
  to match the functions and packages newly imported via NAMESPACE.

  as new peeling criterion option in the PRSP algorithm.

o RELEASE 0.5.8
- Removed pre-selection of variables (covariates) by regular Cox-regression
  and made the remaining Elastic-Net pre-selection of variables optional by
  passing an additional argument in the main function sbh().
- Main function sbh() now returns the parameters used for configuring the parallelization.
- Replaced real dataset #2 of breast cancer data with lung cancer data for reason of size.
- Added S3-generic 'print' function and updated S3-generic 'summary' function.
- Created a new internal subroutine cv.presel() for (optional) variable pre-selection.
- Changed main argument of plot functions from `x` to `object`.
- Minor corrections in the manual.

o RELEASE 0.6.0
- The matrix of original dataset is now returned by the main function sbh() 
  and not the submatrix of pre-selected covariates only.
- Corrected bugs in the output of main function sbh(): 
  . the returned vectors of `pre-selected` and `used` covariates are now in reference 
    to the original index of variables.
  . the value of traces and rules are now matched accordingly.
  . plot_boxtraj() and plot_boxtrace() are now corrected accordingly.  
- The value of `object$cvfit$cv.trace` of the `PRSP` object that is returned 
  by the main function sbh() now only contains the vector of the modal trace values 
  of covariate usage at each step.
- Updated S3-generic 'summary' and 'print' functions.
- Minor updates and corrections in the documentation file and manual.
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-09-14 r69384) and release update to GitHub.

o RELEASE 0.6.2
- Rename example datasets #4 and #5 into #1b and #4, respectively, 
  for consistency with companion article.
- Added argument `decimals` to main function sbh() to output results in
  user-specified significant decimals.
- Added examples for all S3-generic functions.
- Corrected output of decision rules in S3-generic `print` function in case `vs=TRUE`. 
- Renamed results 'varsign`, `selected` and `used` to 'CV.sign`, `CV.selected` and `CV.used` and
  moved them to `cvfit` field of return `PRSP` object.
- Minor improvement in output plot axes names of plot_boxtrace() function.  
- Updates of corresponding modifications in the documentation file and manual.
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-09-14 r69384) and release update to GitHub.

o RELEASE 0.6.3
- Changed random splitting in the cross-validation step to random stratified splitting 
  with/by conservation of events.

                                            `minn` to 5    (instead of 10).
- Modified computation of replicated cross-validated maximal peeling length in order to avoid 
  getting below the minimal box support threshold (i.e. the greater of `beta*n` or `minn`) 
  that could occur when combining results from the cross-validation loops and replicates. 
- Corrected behaviors in case `n` is less than `minn` and `n` is equal to `minn`.
- Updates in the manual file, including added explanation about the outputs of 
  averaged covariate traces, box membership indicators and box decision rules.  
- Updates in the CITATION file.  
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-11-04 r69597) and release update to GitHub.
